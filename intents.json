At the time of maturity, the grain has specific moisture content and special physical characteristics.

Agriculture that does not use irrigation but instead relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed.","Irrigation is the process of applying water to the crops artificially to fulfil their water requirements. Nutrients may also be provided to the crops through irrigation. The various sources of water for irrigation are wells, ponds, lakes, canals, tube-wells and even dams. Irrigation offers moisture required for growth and development, germination and other related functions."]

         "responses": ["There are different types of irrigation practised for improving crop yield. These types of irrigation systems are practised based on the different types of soils, climates, crops and resources. The main types of irrigation followed by farmers include:

Surface Irrigation
In this system, no irrigation pump is involved. Here, water is distributed across the land by gravity.

Localized Irrigation
In this system, water is applied to each plant through a network of pipes under low pressure.

Sprinkler Irrigation
Water is distributed from a central location by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or from sprinklers from the moving platform.

Drip Irrigation
In this type, drops of water are delivered near the roots of the plants. This type of irrigation is rarely used as it requires more maintenance.

Centre Pivot Irrigation
In this, the water is distributed by a sprinkler system moving in a circular pattern.

Sub Irrigation
Water is distributed through a system of pumping stations gates, ditches and canals by raising the water table.

Manual Irrigation
This a labour intensive and time-consuming system of irrigation. Here, the water is distributed through watering cans by manual labour."]

It emphasises the use of management practices in preference to the use of off-farm inputs, taking into account that regional conditions require locally adapted systems. This is accomplished by using, where possible, agronomic, biological, and mechanical methods, as opposed to using synthetic materials, to fulfil any specific function within the system"]
