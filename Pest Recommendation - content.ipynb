    "To get rid of aphids, consider the following suggestions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try spraying cold water on the leaves, sometimes all aphids need is a cool blast to dislodge them.\n",
    "2. If you have a large aphid invasion, dust plants with flour. It constipates the pests. \n",
    "3. Neem oil, insecticidal soaps, and horticultural oils are effective against aphids.\n",
    "4. You can often get rid of aphids by wiping or spraying the leaves of the plant with a mild solution of water and a few drops of dish soap. Soapy water should be reapplied every 2-3 days for 2 weeks.\n",
    "5. One variation of this soap-water mix includes cayenne pepper: Stir together 1 quart water, 1 tsp liquid dish soap, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Do not dilute before spraying on plants.\n",
    "6. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a non-toxic, organic material that will kill aphids. Do not apply DE when plants are in bloom; it is harmful to pollinators, too.''',\n",

    "To get rid of armyworms, consider the following suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Release trichogramma wasps to parasitize any newly laid eggs. These tiny beneficial insects — 1mm or less — insert their eggs inside of pest eggs, killing them before they enter the plant-eating larval stage.\n",
    "2. Other beneficial insects, such as lacewing, ladybugs and minute pirate bugs feed on armyworm eggs as well as the young larval stage. Remember: beneficial ins\n",
    "3. Plant to attract birds and beneficial insects. In the fall, uncover and turn your soil before putting it to bed, giving birds a chance to pick off the exposed pupae.\n",
    "4. Applications of Garden Dust (Bt-kurstaki) or OMRI-listed Monterey Garden Insect Spray (spinosad) will kill armyworms.\n",
    "5. After the season has advanced, natural horticultural oil sprays can be used on plants showing signs of worm infestations. Multi-purpose neem oil spray is effective on various stages of the larvae as well as mites. It also prevents fungus growth. Complete coverage, including undersides of leaves and junctions with stems, is critical.\n",
    "6. Use fast-acting organic insecticides if pest levels become intolerable.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Treat an infestation only when ten eggs or 5 small worms per a hundred cotton plants are present in late July to early August. \\\n",
    "2. Handpick and destroy eggs and small bollworms. This is feasible in small plots or when infestations are low. \n",
    "3. Plough the soil after harvesting. This exposes pupae, which may then be killed by natural enemies or through desiccation by the sun.\n",
    "4. Garlic is reported to be effective against bollworm on cotton and maize.\n",

    "2. Pick Them Up. One surefire but time-consuming way of removing them your property is to remove them manually.\n",
    "3. Change the pH of the Soil. Worms do not like acidic soil.  Applying iron sulfate (found in most lawn and garden stores) every 8 to 10 weeks will keep your soil on the acidic side.  \n",
    "4. Introduce Predatory Species. A natural form of pest control is to introduce a predator species. Some grub worms will feed on earthworms in your soil. \n",
    "5. Pesticides - Try to choose the least toxic form of pesticide available.  Also, choose a pest control chemical specific to worms instead of using one designed to kill a broad range of pests. \n",

Mixing both substances with water and making a spray is the greenest solution you can make.Spray your plants thoroughly and make sure you cover the whole leaf (including the bottom) and the stem.\n",
    "2. Spraying Neem oil on your plants. Apply Neem oil to your plants to repel grasshoppers and prohibit them from laying eggs on your plants.\n",
    "3. Introducing plants that keep the grasshoppers away. Plant flowers like Lilac, Forsythia, Moss rose and Crepe Myrtle deter grasshoppers and can make a nice addition to your garden.\n",

    "2. Mix 3 tablespoons of dish soap with a gallon of water to kill spider mites. Spray the soap solution on infested plant leaves weekly, as needed.\n",

    "3. Mosquitoes can't stand the scent of lavender oil so you can use this to your advantage. Keep mosquitoes away by spraying lavender oil.\n",
    "4. This is a more time-consuming mosquito repellent method, but it works well. You can place dry ice inside a container or trap and eventually, it will attract mosquitoes due to its carbon dioxide emissions. They'll get trapped and die inside of it.\n",

Adding Pyrethrin creates the organic equivalent of a one-two knockdown punch. Pyrethrin is a nerve agent that will absorb into the insect and kill by paralysis.\n",

    "3. Grow snake gourd as it is more resistant to Stem Borers.\n",
    "4. Crop rotation is the key to get rid of stem borers. Avoid planting cucurbits in the same plot, or plant cucumbers, melons or watermelons as borers hardly threaten them.\n",
